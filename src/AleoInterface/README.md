# FOR Aleo

After thoroughly reviewing your documentation and watching this video link, I endeavored to deploy and utilize your smart contracts. However, I encountered an issue: the installation process for your Leo language seems to be malfunctioning. Specifically, the command curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AleoHQ/workshop/master/install.sh | sh did not work as expected.

Despite multiple attempts to seek assistance at your support desk, my issues remain unresolved.

Nonetheless, I want to share our project idea, which focuses on creating a decentralized environmental protection campaign platform. Here's how we envision it working:

Any user can create a unique NFT collection and list it on our marketplace, complete with detailed descriptions of how the proceeds from each sold NFT will be utilized. For instance, an individual crafting nesting boxes could launch a collection where each NFT represents a separate nesting box. These NFTs would be sold with a 25% platform fee, which will then be channeled into a second-stage, DAO-based investment round. In this stage, investors can propose and vote on new smart contracts through an initial voting period, determining the use of the collected funds.
